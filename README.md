# Driving Experiences Website Project
This project was created for a Front-End course in French-Azerbaijani university.
The main objective was to create a site which takes your answers from a web form and stores them in a local storage, which are then all showcased in another site created solely for that reason.

## About the implementation
The code is written in HTML, CSS and Javascript only. In the scope of it, we went through the basics of Javascript and JSON. The sites are optimized for mobile use as well.
